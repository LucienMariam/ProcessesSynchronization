# ProcessesSynchronization
The second lab work in BSUIR for Windows platform [C++ code]

Console application that is a clear example of processes synchronization use.
Main process begets one derived process by pressing “+”,
kills the latest derived process by pressing “-”
and kills all derived processes and terminates program by pressing “q”.
Each process prints a number row (limited by 80 chars) that represents the process number.
Events were used in an effort to perform processes synchronization.

P.S. Do not forget to change static directories.
